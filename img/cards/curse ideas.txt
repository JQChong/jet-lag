Curse of the lie detector

For the next 15/30/60 minutes, hiders may choose to lie while answering the questions. Seekers will then guess whether the hiders are lying. If seekers guessed correctly, hiders do not get reward for the question, otherwise, the reward is doubled.

Casting cost: Hiders must answer photo questions truthfully.



Curse of the smelly breath

The seekers must acquire and consume some durians before asking the next question. Durians can be acquired as a fruit or prepackaged.

Casting cost: Hiders must also acquire and consume durians.
