# Hiding Zones

At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be at a transit station/stop that is included in the game's mapâ€“this now acts as the center of their hiding zone. The hiding zone extends a certain distance in all directions from the transit station, forming a circle within which the hider may move freely until the **end game** begins. For small and medium games, the hiding zone extends 0.5 km from the transit station; for large games, the hiding zone extends 1 km from the transit station. (For more information on hiding zones and hiding spots, visit [Hiding Zones](../hiding/hiding_zones))
