# Radar Questions

Radar questions follow the format, "Are you within \_\_\_\_ of me?" Valid answers are **yes** or **no**. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are a good way of verifying whether you are in the right general area, or crossing off a particularly dense part of the map. (It is easiest to measure these distances using a long press or right click in Google Maps, and using the "Measure" tool.) It's important to note that radars are asking about your location, not your hiding zone. If the radar would encompass part of your hiding zone, but not your location at the time of answering, it would be a miss.

After a radar question has been answered, the hider may **draw 2 cards and keep 1**.

Here's a little diagram to help illustrate how radar questions can work:
