# Preparations before playing the game
The game will be played on this [link](https://jqchong.github.io/jet-lag/). I have tried my very best to convert all imperial units to metric, so it probably will be different from the actual metric version. Welp, it is what it is, and this is what you gotta do to save 100 SGD...

### Rule Book
Read and understand the following sections.

- Quick Start Guide
    - Round Start
    - Hiding Zones
    - Asking Questions
    - The Hider Deck
    - The End Game
    - Rotating Rounds
- Seeking
- Hiding
    - Hiding Zones
    - Hiding Spots
- General Tips

For now you can just skim through The Hider Deck section.

### Life 360
Download Life 360 as it will be used for tracking seekers when you are playing as hiders.
### Game Map
Go to Map Generator at the top right corner of the page, and go through the tutorial first. I will share the game link when it is time to play. All deductions will be based on the answers given by Map Generator.

# Website (Note to self)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch. You need to have a personal access token though, and you will enter the token when the terminal asks for your password.
