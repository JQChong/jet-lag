Curse of the lie detector

For the next 15/30/60 minutes, hiders may choose to lie while answering the questions. Seekers will then guess whether the hiders are lying. If seekers guessed correctly, hiders do not get reward for the question, otherwise, the reward is doubled.

Casting cost: Hiders must answer photo questions truthfully.



Curse of the durian temptation

The seekers must acquire some durians, either as a fruit or prepackaged. Once acquired, seekers must wait 30 minutes before consuming them. No wasting food!

Casting cost: Hiders must also acquire and consume durians.
*implication: seekers cant ride public transportation until they finish their durian lololololol
