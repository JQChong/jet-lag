Curse of the sloth

Hiders may take twice as long to answer subsequent questions. This curse stacks with itself and can be casted at most 1/2/3 times.

Casting cost: Discard a time bonus.
(Clarification: this curse does not stack with hidden hangman, so hiders still need to respond in 30 seconds.)

Curse of the durian temptation

The seekers must acquire some durians, either as a fruit or prepackaged. Once acquired, seekers must wait 30 minutes before consuming them. No wasting food!

Casting cost: Hiders must also acquire and consume durians. Hiders do not need to wait 30 minutes.
(Clarification: Seekers can still ask questions during the 30 minutes of waiting time.)

Curse of the lie detector

Hiders may lie at most once for the next three non-photo questions. Seekers get exactly one guess to guess whether hiders had lied, and which question was not answered truthfully if hiders did lie. If seekers guessed correctly, they get the next question for free. Otherwise, the game continues as per usual.

Casting cost: Discard one card. Moreover, photo questions must be answered truthfully.
